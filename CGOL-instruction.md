>### Using Keyboard Controls:

>- SPACE: Start or pause the simulation.
>- R: Reset the grid with a random distribution of alive and dead cells.
>- C: Clear the grid, making all cells dead.
>- N: Advance the simulation by one step when paused.
>- P: Initialize the grid with a predefined pattern (a glider in this example).

>### Interacting with the Grid:

>- Left Mouse Click: Toggle the state of a cell (alive to dead or dead to alive). Click on any cell to change its state.

>### Simulation Speed:
>- The simulation runs at a default speed of 10 frames per second when running continuously. You can adjust the speed by modifying the speed variable in the code if needed.
>- The sim_speed variable controls the speed of continuous simulation.

>### User Interface:
>- The grid is displayed using Pygame with alive and dead cells visually distinguished.
>- The number of generations that have elapsed is displayed on the screen.
